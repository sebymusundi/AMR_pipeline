 ### Antimicrobial resistance genes pipeline
The pipeline indicated below is to be used in identifying antimicrobial resistance genes using long reads sequenced from Oxford nanopore.
The sequenced samples were previously identified as being resistant to commonly used antibiotics using antibiotics susceptibility tests (ASTs).
